_Here are some example citations:_
After I watched the video on how attack should act. I had a somewhat of a clear understanding of 
how attack function should work however I asked Ben Shaar for help on how attack was supposed to work. 
Me and ben were talking about how attack should work and the overall layout using english words.

* _"I had no idea how to approach Question 3 until classmate Husky Huskington explained how I could break it down into
  separate functions."_
* _"Joseph Aoun and I bounced ideas off each other for Question 4, although we both did our own coding."_
* _"I didn't remember how to convert a string to an int, so I asked Google Bard. It also showed me how to handle an
  exception if the string couldn't be converted."_

_If you did not talk to anybody about the assignment (which would be surprising), please state that._

## Summary questions

Please answer the following questions.

### How many tests passed and how many failed at the start of the Test and Debug section? [1 pt]
_Please also answer whether bugs were in your code, in your tests, or both._
After I complete each method I test the function right after to practice good programming habits.
I forget how many tests passed first try but most of the attack testing failed, one equals, getCurrentStrength 
which I can recall.


### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, and does everything work? [1 pt]

_Either answer "Yes" or describe what you were not able to complete or
get working._
I was not able to get the test attackdoesnotmakeVictimsHealthNegative as I was trying my best
to go through my code and could not figure out. However, everything else works perfect.

### How long did the assignment take you? [1 pt]

_Rather than giving ranges, if you are unsure, give the average of each range._
I believe this assignment took me around 4 hours and 30 mins

### Reflections [3 pts]

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

The most difficult part of the assignment was trying to figure out how attack worked however
the video helped my understanding a lot but it was still hard to figure out to implement it into code.
The most rewarding part of the assignment was when finishing the methods and then running the tests
it was very satisfying to see the red check marks turn green. I learned a lot in this assignment, 
I got a better understanding of how string builder works which is a very useful tool. Also, 
this assignment just overall made me think outside of the box. 

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and lecture are always welcome._
_If there was a TA or classmate who was especially helpful, say so._
