### What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs and state which ones were particularly helpful.
You do not need to cite course materials._ [1 point]
We used chatgpt for the catching part. We tried to implement the numberFormatException mentioned in lecture
however the code did not compile as we hard tested it. We used chatGPT to understand why this Exception did not work.
We learned that scanner.nextInt throws an InputMismatchException instead of the format. Therefore,
we used inputMis to catch the throw. 
For the additional launcher we had a basic understanding since we learned from MeowGuiLauncher and GifGuiLauncher
However, we used chatgpt to understand how to implement our additional launcher as we did not know how to 
direct the user to the website when they launched the certain website. Website.java, for the play()
we learned a lot of the thrown exceptions which was fun to learn and implement all the cases.

## What addition did you make?

_Please describe the behavior and data set._ [2 points]
We created an additional launcher of opening websites. The behavior of it sorts it by alphabetical
and size. The data set includes well known websites for quick access as they are kind of hyperlinks sort of.

## Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and lecture are always welcome._
_If there was a TA or classmate who was especially helpful, say so.
The most difficult part of this assignment was implementing, using, an understanding comparable. We found it difficult
to wrap our head around.
The most rewarding part of this assignment was watching everything run at the end. I learned how Comparables work and I
cleared by understanding of class abstraction
and interfaces.
