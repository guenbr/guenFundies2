# SUMMARY

Please read and follow the assignment instructions on Canvas. Please put your answers here after the italicized
questions.

## What are the GitHub usernames of all students in your group? [1 pt]

_Please indicate the GitHub username(s) used for this assignment on GitHub Classroom._
Did not pair partner with anyone.

## Citations
### Please put your citations here. [5 pts]

_Please include any people or other sources who helped you, and any students whom you helped._
_For each source, make sure to include how they helped you (or how you helped them)._
_Here are some example citations:_

* _"I had no idea how to approach Question 3 until classmate Husky Huskington explained how I could break it down into
  separate functions."_
* _"Joseph Aoun and I bounced ideas off each other for Question 4, although we both did our own coding."_
* _"I didn't remember how to convert a string to an int, so I asked Google Bard. It also showed me how to handle an
  exception if the string couldn't be converted."_

_If you did not talk to anybody about the assignment (which would be surprising), please state that._

Ben Shaar helped me bounce ideas of how step() should work and the logic behind how it chooses random location
and moving the particle there; We did our own coding.
I used chatgpt for how to create random number gen in chatgpt. it gave me rand.

## Summary questions

Please answer the following questions.

### Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, and does everything work? [1 pt]

_Either answer "Yes" or describe what you were not able to complete or
get working._
I believe I was successful in implementing everything that was requested as I watched the demo video and mind looks identical
I think everything works properly as it is the same compared to Professors Rasikas video.

### How long did the assignment take you? [1 pt]

_Rather than giving ranges, if you are unsure, give the average of each range._
It took me around 3 hours maybe since step() was pretty challenging. 

### Reflections [2 pts]

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to **all** of these questions:_

* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and lecture are always welcome._
_If there was a TA who was especially helpful, say so._

The most difficult part of the assignment was the function step() since it required numerous complex physics ideas.
Especially thinking about the logic behind the -1 and +1 and the overall way to code the thinking behind how water
and sand works. The most rewarding part of the assignment was how I was able to play with the similation and be proud
of what I accomplished after spending hours on this assignment. It felt good seeing the water move around and the sand
working properly. This assignment taught me that we are going to be programming very interesting stuff and how I have
the capaibilities to somewhat create a simulator as majority of the code was given.
