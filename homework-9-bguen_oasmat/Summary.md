## Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, and does everything work, to the best of your knowledge? This includes autograder tests.

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass.
This would also be the place to mention any optional milestones you completed_ [1 point]
Yes

## What was the summary sentence output by the program for 50 cities?

_It should be of the form `The minimum spanning tree has __ edges and is __ miles long.`_ [1 point]
The minimum spanning tree has 49 edges and is 8219 miles long.

## How long did the assignment take?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the averages of the range._
[1 point]
2 hours and 45 minutes plus or minus 10 minutes.

## Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code._ [1 points]

We worked with peer TA's Dylan and Yuki. They were very helpful!

## What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not just "Stack Overflow" or "Baeldung") and
state which ones were particularly helpful._ [1 point]

Did not use any outside resources besides the ta's and the videos that were supplied to
understand priority queue and Kruskal's Algorithm

### Reflections

_Give **one or more paragraphs** reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* _Did you get test coverage for all the lines of `find()` and `union()`? Was it hard? Did you find any bugs?_
* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome. If there was a TA who was especially helpful,
say so._

We did indeed get full test coverage for find() and union(), it wasn't that hard, and it did help 
up debug our own code. The most difficult part of this assignment was implementing the nextMethod but not really.
The most rewarding part of this assignment was when running CityGraphics and seeing the output of the min spanning 
tree edges and how long it was. Also, running the tests after implementation and seeing all green coverage of find 
and union. This was very rewarding to see. I learned a lot on priority queues and Kruskal's algorithm as reading
and watching the supplied content was very helpful. Also, reinforcing the ideas behind the union and how
the ranking system works.
