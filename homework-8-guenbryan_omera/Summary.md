## Where can we find your work on github?

_Give the usernames of all teammates and the HTTPS URL of the repository._ [1 point]

## Did you successfully implement everything that was requested?

_Either answer "Yes" or describe what you were and were not able to
implement._ [1 point]
Yes

## Does everything work, to the best of your knowledge? This includes autograder tests.

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass._ [1 point]
Yes
## What was the total amount of time you spent on the assignment?

_Rather than giving a range, if you are unsure, give the average of the range._
[1 point]
Around 6 hours and 45 minutes plus or minus 15.
## Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code._ [1 points]
We worked together by sharing a session with each other to work on the same problem.
We did a pilot style coding which worked very well. We also attended One-on-One TA hours
and went to the office hours in reind which they explained getScore and gameOver
in depth very well.
## What resources did you use?

_Please give specific URLs (not just "Stack Overflow" or "Baeldung") and
state which ones were particularly helpful._ [1 point]
No real outside recources were used. However we did look up on youtube on
the concept of disjoint sets and unions finds and examples in java.
## Reflections

Give one or more paragraphs reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answering all of these questions:

* Did you get test coverage for all the lines of GameModelImplementation? 
  Was it hard? Did you write your tests before, during, or after the implementation?
  Were your tests helpful at catching or preventing bugs?
* What was the most difficult part of the assignment?
* What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?
* What did you learn doing the assignment?

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours, and
lecture are always welcome. If there was a TA or classmate who was especially helpful,
say so._ [4 points]

We got 95% test coverage for all the lines of GameModelImplementation, however; the 5%
was on two if statements that connected the nodes. This was quite confusing because
in our tests we covered all of the instances where it should be covered but did not. However,
we got a 60/60 on the auto grader. It was not really that hard as testing is quite natural.
We wrote the tests after we finished implementing each method to ensure we got them right 
in order to move on to the next one. Our tests pasts automatically but it could have helped
catching bugs automatically. The most difficult part of this assignment was not following directions
but rather reading the files in depth and seeing how to implement union and finder ourselves. Also,
the overall brain power used for this assignment was quite high and got very stress on MileStone 2.
The most rewarding part of this assignment was seeing the 60/60 on the auto grader, which we jumped
out of our seats. During this assignment we learned how union word and how we can find 
if two individual index has the same parent or set. Also, adding the nodes together to one 
like the islands. 
Our constructive and actionable suggestions for experience is how the office hours is very 
packed and not enough tas. A lot of respect for Annish as I always see around 4 people around
him waiting for help on the assignment. And other tas as well. I think this assignment was
a good difficulty level to challenge our brains. Shout out to Dylan Vo as he stayed a little bit later
to help us by explaining how canPlay and makePlay in very good detail.
